## Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix’s content catalog to uncover insights related to **content growth, genre distribution, and global content strategy**. The objective is to understand how Netflix balances **movies vs TV shows**, invests in **international content**, and diversifies its genres to support **user retention and expansion**.

The analysis combines **Python-based data processing** with **interactive Power BI dashboards** to simulate a real-world data analytics workflow.



## Objectives
- Analyze **content growth trends** over the years  
- Compare **Movies vs TV Shows** distribution  
- Identify **top genres** and evaluate content diversification  
- Examine **country-wise content distribution**  
- Build an interactive dashboard for dynamic analysis  



## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL
- Power BI
- Excel
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Exploratory Analysis)



## Dataset
The Netflix dataset used in this project contains information about movies and TV shows, including release year, genre, country, and content type.

The cleaned dataset used for dashboarding was generated using Python after data cleaning and preprocessing.



## Data Processing
- Cleaned and standardized raw Netflix data  
- Handled missing and inconsistent values  
- Normalized multi-genre fields to avoid double counting  
- Prepared analysis-ready data for Power BI  
- Validated metrics by cross-checking Python and Power BI outputs  



## Dashboard Features
### Key KPIs
- Total Titles  
- Movies % vs TV Shows %  
- US % vs Non-US %  

### Visual Insights
- Content growth over years  
- Movies vs TV Shows trend analysis  
- Top 10 genres by unique titles  
- Country-wise content distribution  

### Interactivity
- Filters for **Year, Genre, Country, and Content Type**  
- Dynamic KPI updates based on slicer selection  



## Key Insights
- A significant portion of Netflix content is **Non-US**, highlighting a global-first strategy  
- **TV shows dominate genre diversity**, supporting long-term user retention  
- Top genres contribute a large share while maintaining **moderate diversification**  
- Rapid content growth aligns with Netflix’s international expansion phase  



## Outcome
This project demonstrates the ability to:
